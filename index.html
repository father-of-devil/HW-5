    <p>PUBG Mobile[a] is a free-to-play battle royale video game developed by LightSpeed & Quantum Studio,
         a division of Tencent Games. It is a mobile game adaptation of PUBG: Battlegrounds. 
         It was initially released for Android and iOS on 19 March 2018.

        It was published by multiple publishers in different regions, including Krafton, Tencent, and VNG Games.
        [2][3] By December 2022, PUBG Mobile had accumulated around 1.3 billion downloads while grossing over 
        $9 billion, making it the third highest-grossing mobile game. It is also the second most-played mobile 
        video game of all time.[4] In 2021, the game spawned an Indian version, Battlegrounds Mobile India, and
         a separate game taking place in the PUBG Universe, called New State Mobile.</p>

            <u><h2>CAT</h2></u>
            <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only 
                domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or
                 house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.[4] Cats are commonly kept as
                 house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids 
                 human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill vermin.
                  About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.</p>

            <u><h2>Bike</h2></u>
            <p>Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long-distance travel, commuting, 
                cruising, sport (including racing), and off-road riding. Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and being involved in other related social 
                activities such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies.

                The 1885 Daimler Reitwagen made by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Germany was the first internal combustion, 
                petroleum-fueled motorcycle. In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller became the first series production motorcycle.[4][5]
                
                Globally, motorcycles are comparably popular to cars as a method of transport. In 2021, approximately 58.6 million new motorcycles
                 were sold around the world,[6] fewer than the 66.7 million cars sold over the same period.</p>

        <div class="Eye about-eye">
            <u><h2>Eye</h2></u>
            <p>Eyes are organs of the visual system. They provide living organisms with vision, the ability to receive and process visual detail, as 
                well as enabling several photo response functions that are independent of vision. Eyes detect light and convert it into electro-chemical 
                impulses in neurons (neurones). In higher organisms, the eye is a complex optical system which collects light from the surrounding environment,
                 regulates its intensity through a diaphragm, focuses it through an adjustable assembly of lenses to form an image,
                  converts this image into a set of electrical signals, and transmits these signals to the brain through complex neural pathways that connect the 
                  eye via the optic nerve to the visual cortex and other areas of the brain. Eyes with resolving power have come in ten fundamentally different forms,
                   and 96% of animal species possess a complex optical system.[1] Image-resolving eyes are present in molluscs, chordates and arthropods.[</p>

            <u><h2>Maditation</h2></u>
            <p>Meditation is a practice in which an individual uses a technique – such as mindfulness, or focusing the mind on a particular object, thought, or activity 
                – to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state.[1][2][3][4][web 1][web 2]

                Meditation is practiced in numerous religious traditions. The earliest records of meditation (dhyana) are found in the Upanishads, and meditation plays a
                 salient role in the contemplative repertoire of Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism.[5] Since the 19th century, Asian meditative techniques have spread to other cultures where they have also found
                  application in non-spiritual contexts, such as business and health.</p>
